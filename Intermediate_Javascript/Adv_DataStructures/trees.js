// the html dom is a tree structure
// trees are non linear data structures that contain a root and child nodes
// a binary tree is a tree in which each node can have at most two children
// a binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left node is always less than the parent node and the right node is always greater than the parent node
// the benefit of trees is that they can be used to store data in a way that makes it easy to search, insert, and delete
